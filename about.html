             <h2>About Us</h2>
                 <p>It's been five years since our coffee cart made its debut on the streets of Providence, RI. Fresh out of college, we wholeheartedly understood what it means to be addicted to caffeine. Our most pressing issue regarding this was the amount of money we were spending to add in all those espresso shots that had become weaker and weaker to us as our body's tolerance grew. That was when the team came up with the idea of a coffee strong enough for even the highest of caffeine tolerance, and thus, the Rude Brews brand was born.</p>

                        <h3>Who Are We?</h3> 
                            <p>Rude Brews Coffee Co. started out as a group of five young entreperneurs, fresh out of college. We all knew what college entails from experience; and the need for caffeine that comes with it. We started our own company with a coffee cart until we gained enough popularity and revenue to open our own shop. In the summer of 2015, our shop n Providence, RI hosted its grand opening, and the rest is history.</p>

                            <h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
                            <p>Rude Brews Coffee Co. offers highly caffeinated coffee along with other highly caffeinated products to pack the punch you need to get up and go, regardless of your sleep schedule (college students, we're looking at you).</p>

                            <h3>Where Are We?</h3>
                            <p>Rude Brews Coffee Co. has a few locations throughout New England, including our original shop on 1027 Benefit St. in Providence, RI. We also have shops in Boston, MA, Salem, NH, and Braintree, MA.</p>
