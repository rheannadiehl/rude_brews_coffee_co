                        <h3>Let's go back to the beginning...</h3> 
                            <p>Nine long weeks ago, we got the idea to make a website for our fast-growing brand. We started thinking about the design in terms of how it would look on a mobile device. It was thought that if we could make our mobile site look good, the rest would fall into place with a little scaling for bigger screens and minor alterations. This way, it'd make it easier on our coders, and keep the aesthetic, typography, and color palettes the main focus. Like all good designers, we started our designs in Photoshop, to get the color scheme and other aspects just right. Of course, we went back and forth between typography choices and color palettes, trying to get it perfect.The time we spent on details in the beginning saved us time throughout, and allowed us to perfect the layout and other aspects before jumping into code. We wanted to maintain quality, without making our customers wait too long in anticipation.</p>

                            
                            <p>After working everything out in Photoshop, we moved onto the coding of our website. Our coders built this site using HTML and CSS, all coded by hand. Our mobile site was influenced by a vertical, stacked design. This allowed all of our elements to sit on the page proportionately, and gave it that minimalistic look that's gotten more popular over the years. Once the layout of all our items was put into place, we got to code in the awesome typefaces from Google Fonts, and the social media icons from FontAwesome.</p>

                            
                            <p>Our widescreen layout was simple to code, we just took the same html and content and tweaked it. We replaced our one column layout with three by adding CSS floats inside media queries. This made it so that as you resize the screen or access our site from different medias types, the columns would decrease or increase in number and make the webpage longer or shorter depending on the window size.</p>

                            
                            <p>Now that our main page is complete, we're excited to move onto the remaining pages - about, products, and news. We ask you to please be patient with us as we take the next few days to finish coding these pages. Each page will have a slightly different layout, but will still have the same color palettes and typography that you know and love. We're finally in the home stretch, so hang in there and check back soon to see the completed site!</p>
